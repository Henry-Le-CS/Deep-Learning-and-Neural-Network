# Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Network

Some assignment that I have experienced throughout the course Deep Learning and Neural Network by Andrew Ng of Coursera

- Flower Classifications is a project that use a simple NN with 1 hidden layers to perform binary classifications
- Cat recognitions simply use Logistic Regression to recognize cat or not 
- Cat recognition L-Layer has two folders: W4A1 are the building functions, W4A2 are the model testing folder with cat recognitions
